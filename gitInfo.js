//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitDefinition'.
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what Git is.
*/

//CODE HERE
const gitDefinition = "Git is a tool that manages software changes, so that in the event of a code change which ruins software, the software team can revert to a functional previous version.  The gits are loaded in a repository.  A current version server is another way of thinking about it."

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitHubDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what GitHub is.
*/

//CODE HERE
const gitHubDefinition = "GitHub is a location where you can keep your gits repositories in the cloud.  You've got access to who can be allowed to look at something or change something.  "

//////////////////PROBLEM 3////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitInitDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what 'git init' does.
*/

//CODE HERE
const gitInitDefinition = "git init turns your current folder into a repository which tracks and logs changes."

//////////////////PROBLEM 4////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitCloneDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what 'git clone' does.
*/

//CODE HERE
const gitCloneDefinition ="git clone copies an existing repository into a new directory."

    It should be a string containing your best definition of what 'git status' does.
*/
//CODE HERE
const gitStatusDefinition = 'git status tells you the status of your working tree.  This essentially lets you know whether any changes you have made have been logged into the existing repository.  for instance red marked files are not in the repository, and green marked files are not commited yet.  It lets you at a glance spot whether your work is saved and protected in the repo.'


//////////////////PROBLEM 6////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitAddDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what 'git add' does.

    Create another variable called 'gitAddCode'.  
    It should be a string containing the code to add all files.
*/

//CODE HERE
const gitAddDefinition = 'Git add stages a file to be committed to the repository.  It is a setup step to the next step of commit.  There are two types of add, the git add ., and the git add filename.ext.  The add . adds all files in a directory'

//////////////////PROBLEM 7////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitCommitDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what 'git commit' does.

    Create a variable called 'gitCommitCode'.
